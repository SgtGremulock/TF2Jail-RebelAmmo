# TF2Jail-RebelAmmo
Long story short, when a prisoner (a.k.a a player on the RED team) picks up an ammo pack, they are marked as a rebel if not already. I primarily made this because I found it annoying that prisoners could obtain ammo without anyone noticing and come out of nowhere killing all the guards.
