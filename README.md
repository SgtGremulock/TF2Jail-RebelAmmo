# [TF2Jail] - Rebel Ammo Module
Long story short, when a prisoner (a.k.a a player on the RED team) picks up an ammo pack, they are marked as a rebel if not already. I primarily made this because I found it annoying that prisoners could obtain ammo without anyone noticing and come out of nowhere killing all the guards.

# Installation
1.) Download the plugin and drag and drop the contents (plugins/scripting) into addons/sourcemod.
2.) Load the plugin with sm plugins load TF2Jail_RebelAmmo, changing the map or restarting your server.
3.) The plugin will generate a config file automatically in cfg/sourcemod (TF2Jail_RebelAmmo.cfg) after it has been loaded. The only ConVar is tf2jail_rebelammo_enable which enables/disables the plugin's functionality.
