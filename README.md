2.) Load the plugin with sm plugins load TF2Jail_RebelAmmo, changing the map or restarting your server.

3.) The plugin will generate a config file automatically in cfg/sourcemod (TF2Jail_RebelAmmo.cfg) after it has been loaded. The only ConVar is tf2jail_rebelammo_enable which enables/disables the plugin's functionality.
